ekatra is a Unified Learning Platform that can help instructors to teach students with little dependence on smartphone devices or the internet.

There is a huge digital divide in urban and rural schools. In a recent survey, over 75 pc of students are impacted due to the lockdown as they found it hard to study online, over 80 pc students said they need hand-holding to shift from offline to online and over 25 pc said they need proper training to pursue education online.

ekatra is a tool for educators and organizations to deliver learning at scale, combining the power of Text (SMS & Whatsapp), Audio & Video communication. Our learning platform helps such organizations focused on career readiness for underserved high schoolers to teach them important job and life skills.

Ekatra's long-term vision is to provide quality education to billions of people around the world.






**Tech Stack**

Ekatra’s technical foundation comprises MERN Stack. (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). We use the following core existing technologies in tandem to provide the low data / no data solution to learning. 

The WhatsApp Business API client offers many of the features provided by the WhatsApp applications we already know from Android, iOS, and Web. The difference is that this application can be deployed on a server, providing a local API that allows us to programmatically send and receive messages and integrate a workflow.

Using SMS REST API, we can send and receive SMS messages, track the delivery of sent messages, and retrieve and modify message history. We are able to deliver SMS to your end-users, no matter where they are, with global senders and redundant telecommunications infrastructure. We’ve solved the challenges of scale with configurable software to power phone number management, sender selection, compliance, content, and replies. 

Voice API helps us to make, receive, and monitor calls around the world. Using a REST API, we can make outgoing calls, modify calls in progress, and query metadata about calls created. More advanced call features like programmatic call control, creating conference calls and call queues,  call recordings, and conversational IVRs are possible. 

OpenAI GPT-3 API provides a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, which makes it possible to apply it to virtually any language task. This is different from most other languages APIs, which are designed for a single task, such as sentiment classification or named entity recognition.
